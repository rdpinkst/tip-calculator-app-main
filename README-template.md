## My process

The structure of this app was the first thing that needed to be done, coding up the semantic HTML5 markup.  CSS was then used to style the app, getting it looking as close to the design file pictures as possible.  The app now looked good, but needed some interactivity.  Javascript came to the rescue.  Using javascript I manipulated the DOM, getting the input values for bill total, tip percentage, and number of people.  These values where then used to calculate the tip amount each person needed to pay, along with the total bill each person had to pay.  


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

Building this project I saw how numbers act in javascript.  Not getting the number you think, but that many numbers after the decimal place.  To correct this, when I changed the DOM I converted the number to a string with two decimal places.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
